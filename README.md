# Weather Dashboard

## Description:

The primary goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard using Open Weather API.

- Provides current temperature, icon (ie cloudy, sunny, etc), wind, and humidity
- Shows 5-day forecast with same data as above
- Previously searched cities appear as buttons under search bar

## Instructions:

Upload index.html and assets folder (contains script and stylesheet) to browser.

## Links:

- [Webpage]()
- [Repository]()

## Future Development:

This webpage is designed for desktop screens; it is not responsive on smaller screens. Page prevents empty searches; however, invalid city names are currently allowed with flawed return.
