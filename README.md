# Weather Dashboard

## Description:

The primary goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard using Open Weather API.

- Provides current temperature, icon (ie cloudy, sunny, etc), wind, and humidity
- Shows 5-day forecast with same data as above
- Previously searched cities appear as buttons under search bar (up to 8 cities)

## Instructions:

Upload index.html and assets folder (contains script and stylesheet) to browser.

## Links:

- [Webpage](https://lornaburns.github.io/weather-forecast-23/)
- [Repository](https://github.com/lornaburns/weather-forecast-23)

## Future Development:

This webpage is designed for desktop screens; it is not responsive on smaller screens. Page prevents empty searches; however, invalid city names are currently allowed with a flawed return. Future development could also hide empty elements on page load.
